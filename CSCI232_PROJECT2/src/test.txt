The spell check code needs to output the identical text, except for mispeled words. Even things with unique questionably-used punctuattion's. Also the amount of whitespace     needs to be preserved. There are probably things that are not included here that you may want to check. Just because your code werks for this file does not mean it will wark for what the TA's test them on --@-- They're going to use whatever test files (dictionery and text file) they want.
